Hi, I'm a Data Engineer at Republic Wireless. I get to spend my days working on everything from optimizing database storage mechanics to data visualization (and everything in between).

The best part of my job [, my team, and my company] is the freedom I have to learn new technologies and methodologies through direct application within the bounds on my job responsibilities.

Through my curiosity (and job responsibilities), I've been able to successfully learn and utilize:
* Python
    * [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) - pipeline framework, written in Python
        * [Collaborator](https://github.com/spotify/luigi/commits?author=dlstadther)
    * Virtualenv
    * Flask - [deployment]
    * Django - [vaguely]
* Data Stores
    * Redshift
    * PostgreSQL
    * MySQL
    * SQLite
* AWS
    * EC2
    * EMR
    * IAM
    * Lambda
    * RDS
    * Redshift
    * S3
    * VPC
* \*UNIX
    * Shell
    * SSH
    * SCP
    * Make
* CI/CD
    * Jenkins - for recurring application deployment
    * Jenkins Pipeline - continuous delivery (CD) definition as code
    * Ansible - configuration management
* IDEs (of various sorts)
    * PyCharm
    * DataGrip
    * SQLWorkbench
    * Sublime Text 3
    * IntelliJ
    * PhpStorm
    * VIM
    * Spacemacs
* Other
    * Markdown
    * ReSTructured Text

Outside of work, I priodically dabble in technical reading, tutorials, and half-baked personal projects.

On many occasions, I've tried my hand at web-based frameworks and their various implementations (raw html/js/css; pyramid; django; flask; and now jekyll (again)). After many abandoned web projects, I believe I've found that I get bogged down in the boilerplate required to format and render pretty pictures and aesthetically pleasing layouts that I inevitably leave them orphaned.

My hope is that between the Minima theme, Jekyll building and serving, and GitHub Pages hosting, I'll keep this process simple enough that I won't abandon yet another website.

Stick with me to find out!

[intro to building and carpentry]

[why i didn't want to put a hangboard inside]

Given my intrigue of engineering, desire to train for climbing at home, and preference for my garage to house my project, I decided to build a wall support for a hangboard.

Before beginning this project, I needed a hangboard to which to build around. To Craigslist, I went! After about a month or so, I found someone selling a Metolius Simulator 3D (the older model) for real cheap. I believe I only paid $20 for it!

Now that I had a board, I then knew the dimensions I had to work with for the face of the support.

Given the face dimensions and preferred distance away from wall, I chose my measurements such that I would only need to purchase a single sheet of MDF.

[I went to Lowes, had to ask for the .75" MDF which was on the very very top of the storage shelving. They grabbed the wrong stuff at first, so they gave me a discount for waiting patiently for over 10 minutes. I then measured and marked my sheet and got an employee to cut it for me on their saw.]

[The installation utilized a temporary support board to allow me to not worry about holding the MDF structure in the air, but rather just to push it towards the wall. I had to push the structure into the wall while drilling through the back of the structure and into where I had identified my wall studs. Eight 4" lag screws were used to attach the support onto the wall.]

[The triangular cutouts were repurposed to create small corner shelves inside of the support.]

[How that the structure had been installed, could it even hold my weight?]

## How much weight can it hold?

## Areas of Improvement
* MDF cut plans, should've included buffer between pieces to account for width of saw blade
* MDF is strong when drill into from it's finished face, not so much from it's profile
    * this means pilot holes were key - i got a little too confident in a couple spots
* asthetics could have benefited from countersinks
* clamped track for free-hand circular saw usage

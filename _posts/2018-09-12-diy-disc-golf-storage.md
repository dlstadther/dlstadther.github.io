title: "DIY: Disc Golf Storage"

During the summer of 2017, I picked up the sport of Disc Golf. Like many activities I participate in, I was all-in. It only took a couple months for me to reach a point where I was ready to be competitive.

I've found that as I invest my time into an activity, I also finanically invest myself. After a little over a year, I had acquired quite a few discs and was in need of an appropriate method of storage such that I could keep them organized and easily accessible.

I won't go into depth too much here. But the gist is that I found someone's plans on Reddit. I adapted them for my purpose, spent $23 at Lowes, and an hour of my time cutting and assembling.

Maybe I'll eventually clean up my build plans and post them here. But until then, enjoy a couple images!

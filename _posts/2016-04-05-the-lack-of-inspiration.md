title: "Inspiration and the Lack Thereof"

One of the greatest challenges I've faced in my academic and professional career (however brief) has been independent ingenuity.
It stares me in the face as I read HackNews articles and peers' blogs.
These Computer Scientists, Software Engineers, and Data Scientists are able to come up with some sort of interesting project and produce a legitimate product or meaningful analysis.
I wouldn't be telling the truth if I didn't say I was envious of their creative insight.

Even in my job, I find that I am good at solving problems. Point out something that needs to be done or improved/updated/etc. and I can output some result.
However, without that guidance I often feel lost.

I've tried doing some independent "weekend projects" on my own, but none of them ever get finished - either due to lack of interest in the project itself or due to the daunting nature of it.
By no means have I even produced a thought of some novel work. Basically my list of projects (which remains written on a whiteboard in my living room) consists of:
* (Pure) Python DBMS (tk frontend, sqlalchemy backend)
    * inspired by my sub-par opinion of sql-workbench for redshift
    * and love for python with the curiosity of "is this possible?"
* Remotely accessible media server
    * so that I can access my digital media and academic library remotely without reliance on significant cloud storage
* Websites
    * this one, and stadther.net (currently a redirect here)

All these projects, while useful (to me), seem very lackluster; thus diminishing my motivation.

I've been reassured by my mentors and superiors that inspiration and insight come with experience, but of course it's easy to be a doubting Thomas.

One day (I hope), I'll look back to this and things will click. However, until that day I'll continue seeking inspiration.
